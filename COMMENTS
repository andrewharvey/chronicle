   Chronicle, since version 2.0, supports the submission of post
 comments.

  The way this works is rather non-standard so please read this 
 document to understand it.


Basic Usage
-----------

  The basic use of chronicle is to convert a collection of text files
 into a HTML & RSS blog.

  Generally it appears that people will do this upon a local machine,
 then scp, rsync, or otherwise move the output into place upon their
 remote webserver.

  This process looks something like this:

        chronicle --input=./blog --output=./html
        rsync html user@host:/path/to/blog


Advanced Usage
--------------

  Since the blog, once produced, is typically stored upon a remote 
 system there is no easy way for comments which are stored upon that
 system to be integrated into the main blog.

  The solution to this problem is to merely record comments upon
 the webserver in simple text files.

  Later these can be fetched to the machine which is building the
 blog, and integrated for the next rebuild:


       scp uesr@host://path/to/comments/* ./comments/
       chronicle --input=./blog --output=./html --comments=./comments
       rsync html user@host:/path/to/blog
