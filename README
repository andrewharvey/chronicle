chronicle - A blog compiler
---------------------------

  Chronicle is a tool which will convert a directory of text files
 into a static HTML weblog, or blog.

  The system supports tagged entries, and several other useful features,
 but it is primarily designed to be as simple to possible to install
 and use.


Installation
------------

  No installation is currently required; simply create your blog entries
 in the data/ directory and run "./bin/chronicle" to create HTML files
 in the output/ directory.

  Each output page will be re-created from scratch at this point, so
 if you've edited any of your files they will be regenerated to include
 your updated text.



Blog Format
-----------

  The blog format is very simple.  Each file should start like this:

   --
   title:  The title of my post
   date: 12 August 2007
   tags: foo, bar, baz
   ...
   ...
   ...
   --

  The tags are optional, but recommended, similarly the date of the post
 is used in preference to the current date.


Customisation
-------------

  Templates are used to create the output, and you will find those
 located within the ./etc/ directory.
